		<h2>Reflection of The Program:</h2>
			<p>Overall this program is a great program to in touch with new technology and try and learn new progrmas, I have been apart of this program for almost three years now and it has taught me so many wonderful things. It has helped me with everything related to school homework, projects, slideshow's and even movies! I am very thankful to be in a program that involves technology which some schools do not even have access to. Me learning technology is a great skill to teach anyone young or old and I think that this program would be best for students who want to get more in depth with technology.I think the program itself still is advancing and getting or growing bigger. As it advances the program itself gets more gear and diffrent types of equipment</p>

		<h2>My Future:</h2>
			<p>Honestly, I planned my future out to a clear path for what I strive for in life. So since I'm still in middle school i am thinking about attending Milikan High School and going into the "Peace" program and starting a career in some type of government. After high school Im thinking about attending the school next to L.A not USC but UCLA. I would really like to study medicine and go into that field. I have been very supported through the whole length of my life, my parents are awsome and so is the rest of my family as well as friends have always been there for me.  </p>
